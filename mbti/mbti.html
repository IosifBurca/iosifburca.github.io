            <h4>The Architect</h4>
            <p class="desc">INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design.
                They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want
                to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="desc">INTPs are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them
                because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time focused internally:
                exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding. To the Architect, life is an ongoing
                inquiry into the mysteries of the universe.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="desc">Famous INTPs include Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Rene Descartes, Charles Darwin,
                Marie Curie, Socrates, and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="desc">Popular leisure activities for an INTP include reading, art and cultural events, chess and
                other strategy games, writing, taking classes, working with computers, backpacking, hiking, and
                meditation.</p>
